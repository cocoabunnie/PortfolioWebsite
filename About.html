        <p class=myStory>
            I learned my very first programming language when I was 11 through making my very first computer 
            game called “Space Puppies” with my dad who was also a software engineer. Ever since then, I knew 
            programming was something I wanted to pursue as a career.

            As I learned more about technology, software and the impact it can have on the lives of others, 
            I saw the power behind programming itself, and the potential it had to enhance our lives, help people, 
            and evolve our society. Because of this, it's no secret that the society we live in is moving closer 
            towards a more technologically advanced future, and I want nothing more than to be a part of this amazing 
            movement.
